# Getting started with the robloxalts.info API
**We have already included some examples of using the API [here](https://github.com/IlIlIllIIlI/robloxalts-public/tree/main/api-examples)**

*If your desired language is included feel free to use the example to learn!*



# Usage

*Using the robloxalts.info API is very simple!*

**Generating alts**

To generate an alt, you will want to make a **POST** request to `https://accounts.robloxalts.info/api/public/demand/generate`.

Include your `apikey` (*your API key* and `amount` (*the amount of alts you want to receive*) in the request data (application/json)

**ReqBin Example**

*If you still don't understand take a look at the ReqBin.com example. If you do decide to use ReqBin.com, make sure to use the EXT mode because of our firewall!*
